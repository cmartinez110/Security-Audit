<h1>Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I reviewed a document that outlined the scope and objectives of a security audit for a fictional company called Botium Toys. During the review, I assessed the adequacy of existing controls and identified areas where improvements were needed. In the final report, I issued a memorandum to stakeholders, proposing the implementation of effective controls to strengthen Botium Toys' security posture.
